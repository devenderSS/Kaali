    <p>This is my first ever design project. It is been just two days since I first used any graphic software. I have created some watchface themes which can be used with smartwatches.
    <br>Each theme covers two screens. Time-face and notification-face. Time-face contains hour and minute needles. Notification-face shows date, day and notifications.<br>Watch's edge should level with display. That means dark backgrounds should blend with edges.<br>The shines on screen(comics and sweet) are part of display.</p>
